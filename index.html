         <h2 id="title"> The Haitian - Dominican Border Situation </h1>

          <h3 id="by">By Rosalía Jiménez</h3>

         <p>
           The 2015 Plan for the Regulatization of Foreigners in the Dominican Republic (DR) is an initiative launched in the DR, under President Danilo Medina, created to legitimate undocumented people's immigration status in the country by allowing these immigrants apply for a legal status in DR.

           <br>

           Even though it had a lot of positive outcomes, this also provoked the returnement of not less than 250,000 Haitian and Dominicans of Haitian descent labouring in DR to Haiti bewtween June 2015 and March 2018. Many of the deportations that came from this regulation plan "did not meet international standards" since many of them left under pressure or even threat. Consequently, this left people in a non-notice limbo of erratic deportations, creating a lot of public argument and general disagreement. 

           <br> 
           <br>

           After the ending of th Plan for the Regularization of Foreigners in 2018, over 200,000 Haitians stayed in the DR without legal paperwork, risking themselves to be deported.

          <br> 
          <br>

          Today, Haiti not only faces economic, political and social instability, it's also dealing with many environmental issues that bring within other situations like poor sanitation and food as a result of not having enough natural resources + bad management of goods; But this doesn't mean that haitians are any safer in the DR. The deportation and irregular immigration statuses of haitians caused a congested illicit trade between Haiti and Dominican Republic in the border.
